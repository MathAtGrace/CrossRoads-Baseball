## Top Players in the Crossroads League

After compiling advanced batting statistics for each team, we chose to use weighted runs created plus (wRC+) in order to evaluate a hitter's overall contribution to the team. The following is a list of the top 10 hitters in the Crossroads League in 2019.



```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(head(Best_Players,10), row.names = FALSE, col.names=c("Team", "Player","wRC+", "PA")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped")) %>%
    footnote(general = "*min. 20 plate appearances", general_title = "")
```
